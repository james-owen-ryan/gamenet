    <div class="question">What is this?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">GameSage is a tool for game discovery that was built using techniques from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">natural language
            processing</a>. Starting from your description of a game, you'll get an interactive listing of
        the existing games that are most related to it. GameSage is not currently optimized for
        mobile viewing.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="question">How do I use it?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">Click the sage to begin. Once you do this, you'll be taken to a new page, where the
        sage will ask you to describe a game. You may use a description of a game you would like to develop
        or are developing, a game that already exists (whose title you've forgotten), the type of game you'd like
        to play, or any other kind of game description. Feel free to copy and paste text from another website or
        from anywhere else. If you can't think of what to write about, click the button that says 'Guide Me'.

    <br>
    <div class="answer">UC Santa Cruz PhD students
        <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jor/" target="_blank">James Ryan</a> and
      <a href="http://erickaltman.com/" target="_blank">Eric Kaltman</a>. We made it as part of the larger
        <a href="http://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">
      Game Metadata and Citation Project</a> (GAMECIP), a multi-year joint initiative between UC Santa Cruz
        and Stanford that is funded by the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/" target="_blank">
            Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> (grant LG-06-13-0205-13).
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="question">How does it work?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">GameSage is an interface to its companion tool
        <a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamenet" target="_blank">
            GameNet</a>, which is is a network
        of existing games that are linked according to how related they are to one another.
        We built GameNet by submitting Wikipedia articles about games to
        a technique from natural language processing called latent semantic analysis (LSA).
        LSA works from the premises that words that occur in similar contexts will tend to have
        similar meanings and that texts that are composed of similar words will tend to be
        topically similar. By the technique, words get attributed computable representations that
        are determined by the contexts in which they appear (in our case, the Wikipedia articles) and
        the contexts themselves (those Wikipedia articles) likewise get attributed computable representations
        according to which words appear in them. The cool thing about LSA is that it may be able to
        infer that two words that
        do not appear together in any context (perhaps dialectal variants that denote the same thing,
        like 'gas' and 'petrol') are in fact highly semantically related. By the same token, it may infer
        the semantic relatedness of two contexts that have no terms in common. This ability to learn
        global associations from local co-occurrences is the achievement of LSA and what led to it becoming
        one of the major natural language processing techniques of the last twenty years. For this project, we extracted 11,829
        Wikipedia articles that describe individual games and submitted these to LSA. By taking the computable
        representation that LSA gave to the games' Wikipedia articles and using them as a way of representing the
        games themselves, we can automatically determine how related any game is to any other game among the
        11,829 included in our model. This is how GameNet is able to reason about game relatedness. GameSage works
        by exploiting the notion in LSA of 'folding in', whereby a new text that was not used to train the model
        gets injected into it. Specifically, GameSage takes a description of a game and processes it by the exact
        same method that was used to process the original Wikipedia articles, thereby finding the existing games
        that are most related to the description. For more information about GameSage, see
        <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jor/publications/ryanToolsForVideogameDiscovery.pdf" target="_blank">
            this short paper</a> that accompanied a demo of the tool at a recent academic conference.

    <br><br>
    <div class="question">Can you say more about LSA and your model?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">
        From a corpus of text, a co-occurrence matrix of its words and documents (the
        individual texts that make up the corpus) is built; this matrix specifies
        which words occurred in which documents (and thereby which documents words occurred in). The columns and
        rows in this matrix can be thought of as vectors that represent the meanings, in an approximate sense,
        of the words and documents that they correspond to; this is called a vector space model of semantics.
        LSA is an example of such a model, but its hallmark is that it reduces the dimensionality of these vectors
        by a matrix-factorization algorithm called singular value decomposition. Remarkably,
        doing this allows the model to, as we've said above, infer semantic associations that are not encoded in the full
        co-occurrence matrix. Having an LSA model, one can easily calculate how semantically related any of its
        documents are by taking the cosine between their LSA vectors. In corpora in which each document pertains
        to a specific individual concept, such as a corpus comprising encyclopedia entries, these relatedness scores
        can reasonably be utilized as a measure of the relatedness of the concepts themselves. Crucially, we
        relied on this notion in training our LSA model on the corpus comprising Wikipedia articles for
        11,829 videogames, which we mentioned above. By this model,
        we can quantify how related any two of these games are by taking the cosine between their LSA vectors.
